I like to write code. And take pictures. And read books. And drive around the country. And doing things to make life easier.

In 2012, the most wonderful lady in the world [agreed to marry](http://www.meandthegeek.com) this geek. In 2013, we had our cute little daughter, and in 2015 we're expecting our next child.
