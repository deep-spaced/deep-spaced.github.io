<img src="/images/andrew.jpg" class="right" />

I like to [write code](https://github.com/GimliLongBow). And [take pictures](http://substratalcode.smugmug.com/). And [read books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36469128-andrew-anderson). And drive around the country. And doing things to make life easier.

In 2012, the most wonderful lady in the world [agreed to marry](http://www.meandthegeek.com) this geek. In 2013, we had our cute little daughter, and in 2015 our fun little son was born. Next up? Who knows!?!?
